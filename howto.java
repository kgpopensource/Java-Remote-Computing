"1> Java Remote Computing(JRC) works only in a Local Area Network. It will not work on the internet.(Future version will !) \n\n"+

"2> To use JRC you must have JRC.jar file at both the end computer in LAN and your pc's firewall should allow this application. Otherwise it will create some errors.(It may not display screen)\n\n"+

"3> To start the application just double click on the .jar file or goto cmd and change the directory to the directory where your jar file is and execute 'java -jar JRC.jar' command.\n\n" +

"4> Now wait untill your GUI starts properly.\n\n"+

"5> Once the GUI has been started first you have to start the server by clicking on the 'start server' button. It will prompt for the IP port number, user id ,password . Ip is just for user's conveniency .It will be displayed at the server status area so user doesn't have to every time check ip from network connections for the session.\n\n"+

"6> ID and Password are for authentication.\n\n" +

"7> Once server has been started you can control it from another pc by connecting it.\n\n"+

"8> To control the remoter pc you must first start the server at the remote pc.\n\n"+

"9> Now click on the 'connect server' button, it will prompt you for ip ,port ,user id and password which you just gave on the remote pc.\n\n"+

"10> If 'connection successfull' messege comes then you can use 'remote control' button to start remote controlling or you can send files from file transfer panel.\n\n"+

"11> For text chatting you must start server at both ends and connect it to each other. \n\n");
